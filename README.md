# Lab-1-Timetabled
In this project, you will build a grid-style calendar with one-hour events that plan out a single week. You must create the calendar for someone else. This can be a friend, family member, historical figure, role model, or imaginary person. Timetables can be informative, humorous, or exploratory.
